### Make sure that the loan_train.csv and loan_test.csv file is in the same folder as this notebook.

Various classification algortihm are implemented on one csv file, and at the end evaluation of each algorithm is done.
Classification Algorithm implemented are: 
                                       1)  K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
                                       2)  Decision Tree
                                       3)  Support Vector Machine (SVM)
                                       4)  Logistic Regression
